🛍️Frontend Web Design
DevHub Internship — Task 01

This is a modern and fully responsive e-commerce website built using just HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript — no frameworks! It simulates a real online shopping experience where users can browse products, add them to a cart, search, filter by category, and even subscribe to a newsletter.

🚀 What’s Inside
🛒 Working Shopping Cart
Users can add items to a cart, change quantities, or remove them. The cart even remembers what you added using localStorage, so it stays there if you refresh the page.

🧭 Category Sidebar
Filter products by category easily — no reloads, just smooth filtering.

🔎 Live Search
A functional search bar that helps users find what they need by name or description.

⏳ Countdown Deals
Real-time countdown timer shows time left for special offers. It resets once the time runs out.

📬 Newsletter Signup
Validates email format and shows a success or error message when users try to subscribe.

💬 Toast Messages
Instant feedback when users perform actions — like adding to cart or entering an invalid email.

📱 Mobile-Friendly Design
The layout adjusts perfectly on mobile, tablet, or desktop. Even the sidebar and nav menu respond based on screen size.

⭐ Nice UI Touches
Product ratings, discounts, hover animations, smooth transitions — all the little things that make a shopping site feel polished.
